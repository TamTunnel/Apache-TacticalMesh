# Layman's Guide to Apache TacticalMesh

This guide explains Apache TacticalMesh in simple, non-technical terms.

## What is it?

**Apache TacticalMesh** is open-source software that lets military units, first responders, and disaster teams communicate even when cell towers are down or radios are jammed. It automatically routes messages through nearby team members—like a smart relay race. It's free, works anywhere, and replaces $50,000 proprietary radios with commodity laptops.

I built it to solve a real problem: soldiers losing comms in the field cost lives.

## Analogy for Non-Techies

Think of it like **Waze for military radios**:

*   **Waze** finds the fastest driving route by checking traffic.
*   **TacticalMesh** finds the fastest *communication* path by checking which soldiers can reach headquarters.

If one road is blocked (radio is jammed), Waze finds another route. Same with TacticalMesh—if one path fails, it automatically finds another soldier to relay through.

## Why Open Source Matters

### Closed/Proprietary Systems
*   **Cost:** $50K per radio
*   **Vendor:** Only works with one company's gear
*   **Updates:** Wait months for patches
*   **Trust:** Can't see how it works (black box)

### Apache TacticalMesh (Open Source)
*   **Cost:** $0 (free forever)
*   **Vendor:** Works with any hardware (Dell laptops, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
*   **Updates:** Fix bugs yourself or community helps instantly
*   **Trust:** All code is public—no backdoors, no secrets
